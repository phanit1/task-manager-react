# Task Manager Application

This project is a Task Manager application built with React. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd task-manager
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
### Usage

To use the Task Manager application, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
3. You will see the Task Manager application interface.
4. To add a new task, enter the task details in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
5. To edit an existing task, click the "Edit" button next to the task, modify the task details, and click "Save".
6. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.

You can manage your tasks by adding, editing, and deleting them as needed.
### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
